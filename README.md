An interpreter for the Shakespeare Programming Language, implemented in Python.

#### What is the Shakespeare Programming Language?

The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is a programming language with source code that looks like Shakespeare's plays. The language is Turing complete, so theoretically just as powerful as any other language. It's a lot of fun to write but not practical for any large projects. More info can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language).

Note: Shakespeare's actual plays are not valid SPL. SPL does not aim to provide backwards compatibility with legacy code written ~400 years ago.

#### What is this project?

This is an interpreter I wrote for SPL. It's written in Python. The aim is to help programmers better understand how their SPL code is executing, with features like REPL and debugging. All previous implementations of SPL were cross-compilers, which makes an already confusing language even harder to follow.

#### What state is this project in?

I haven't written any tests yet, but it will *probably* run any valid SPL program. Features like REPL and debugging are coming Soon™.
